## 💻 Computer Science Student/ Self-Taught Programmer

✌️ Hi! I am a computer science student currently taking a break from school. Currently, I am self-teaching myself right now until I go back to school. I aspire to become a software engineer for my career. I am enjoying every bit of it. In my spare time, I enjoy going to the gym💪 and streaming🎮.
